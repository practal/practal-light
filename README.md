# Practal Light

This is a research prototype for exploring the [Practal](https://practal.com) design space. 

Practal Light implements [*Practical Types*](https://doi.org/10.47757/practical.types.1) as its logic.

Mock theory development is currently done in the [`testTheory`]](https://github.com/practal/practal-light/blob/main/Tests/practal-lightTests/practal_lightTests.swift#L48) test case.
